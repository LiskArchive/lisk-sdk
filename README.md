Lisk is a next generation crypto-currency and decentralized application platform, written entirely in JavaScript. The official documentation about the whole ecosystem can be found in https://lisk.io/documentation.

[Lisk Core](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core) is the program that implements the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). In other words, Lisk Core is what every machine needs to set-up in order to run a node that allows for participation in the network.

This document details how to install Lisk Core from source, but there are two other ways to participate in the network: [binaries](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/pre-install/binary) and [Docker images](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/pre-install/docker).
If you have satisfied the requirements from the Pre-Installation section, you can jumpt directly to the next section [Installation Steps](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk#installation-steps).

## Pre-Installation

The next section details the prerequisites to install Lisk Core from source using the different tagged releases.

    ```

### Node.js (<https://nodejs.org/>)

* Node.js serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

  Install System wide via package manager:

  * Ubuntu 14|16 / Debian:

    ```
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```

  * MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

    ```
    brew install node@8.11.3
    ```

* _(Recommended)_ Install using a version manager such as nvm.

  1. Install nvm following their instructions (https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
  2. Install the correct version of Node.js using nvm:

  ```
  nvm install v8.11.3
  ```

* _(Recommended)_ PM2 (<https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>) -- PM2 manages the node process for Lisk

  ```
  npm install -g pm2
  ```

### PostgreSQL (version 9.6):

* Ubuntu 14|16 / Debian:

```
curl -sL "https://downloads.lisk.io/scripts/setup_postgresql.Linux" | bash -
sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb $USER
createdb lisk_test
createdb lisk_main
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_test -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_main -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

```
brew install postgresql@9.6
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
brew services start postgresql@9.6
createdb lisk_test
createdb lisk_main
```

### Installing Redis

* Ubuntu 14|16 / Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

Start redis:

```
service redis start
```

Stop redis:

```
service redis stop
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

```
brew install redis
```

Start redis:

```
brew services start redis
```

Stop redis:

```
brew services stop redis
```

**NOTE:** Lisk does not run on the Redis default port of 6379. Instead it is configured to run on port: 6380. Because of this, in order for Lisk to run, you have one of two options:

1. **Change the Lisk configuration**

Update the redis port configuration in the `config.json` file to the Redis default `redis.port=6379`. This is the easiest option, however, be mindful of reverting the changes when you make a pull request.

2. **Change the Redis launch configuration**

Update the Redis launch configuration file on your system. Note that their a number of ways to do this. The following is one way:

1. Stop redis-server
2. Edit the file `redis.conf` and change: `port 6379` to `port 6380`
   * Ubuntu 14|16 / Debian: `/etc/redis/redis.conf`
   * MacOS: `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf`
3. Start redis-server

Now confirm that redis is running on `port 6380`:

```
redis-cli -p 6380
ping
```

And you should get the result `PONG`. TO update the redis port in Lisk configuration, check the section [Configuring Lisk](#configuring-lisk)

## Installation Steps

Before you proceed, you need to decide if you want to connect your node to the Testnet (Test Network), to the Mainnet (Main Network) or to work in your own network. In order to connect your node with the _Mainnet_ for example, clone this Lisk Core repository from the master branch and initialize the modules.

```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
git checkout master
npm install
```

## Managing Lisk

To test Lisk is built and configured correctly, issue the following command:

```
node app.js
```

This will start the lisk instance with `devnet` configuration. Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `pm2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

```
pm2 start --name lisk app.js
```

After the process is started, its runtime status and log location can be retrieved by issuing the following command:

```
pm2 show lisk
```

To stop Lisk after it has been started with `pm2`, issue the following command:

```
pm2 stop lisk
```

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:

```
pm2 start --name lisk app.js -- -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path] -n [network]
```

You can pass any of `devnet`, `alphanet`, `betanet`, `testnet` or `mainnet` for the network option.

## Configuring Lisk

### Structure

1. The Lisk configuration is managed under different folder structures.
2. Root folder for all configuration is `./config/`.
3. Default configuration file that used as base is `config/default/config.json`
4. You can find network specific configurations under `config/<network>/config.json`
5. Don't override any value in above mentioned files if you need custom configuration.
6. Create your own `json` file and pass it as command line options `-c` or `LISK_CONFIG_FILE`
7. Configurations will be loaded in following order, lowest in the list have highest priority:
   * Default configuration file
   * Network specific configuration file
   * Custom configuration file (if specified by user)
   * Command line configurations, specified as command `flags` or `env` variables
8. For development purposes use `devnet` as network option, others network are specific to public lisk networks.

### Command Line Options

There are plenty of options available that you can use to override configuration on runtime while starting the lisk.

```
node app.js [options]
```

Each of that option can be appended on command line. There are also few `ENV` variables that can be utilized for this purpose.

#### Note

* All `ENV` variables restricted with operating system constraint of `ENV` variable maximum length.
* Comma separated lists will replace the original config values. e.g. If you specify `LISK_PEERS`, original `peers.list` specific to network will be replaced completely.

For more detail understanding of configuration read this [online documentation](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/user-guide/configuration)

### Examples

#### Change Redis Port

Update the `redis.port` configuration attribute in `config/devnet/config.json` or any other network you want to configure.

## Tests

### Preparing Node

1. Recreate the database in order to run the tests against a new blockchain:

```
dropdb lisk_dev
createdb lisk_dev
```

2. Launch Lisk (runs on port 4000):

```
NODE_ENV=test node app.js
```

### Running Tests

Tests are run using the following command:

```
npm test -- mocha:<tag>:<suite>:[section]
```

* Where **tag** can be one of `default | unstable | slow | extensive` (required)
* Where **suite** can be one of `unit | integration | functional | network` (required)
* Where **section** depending of the chosen suite can be:
  * when `functional` --> `get | post | ws` (optional)

Examples:

```
npm test -- mocha:slow:unit
npm test -- mocha:extensive:integration
npm test -- mocha:default:functional
npm test -- mocha:unstable:functional:get
npm test -- mocha:untagged:network
```

Individual test files can be run using the following command:

```
npm run mocha -- path/to/test.js
```

## Utility scripts

There are couple of command line scripts that facilitate users of lisk to perform handy operations. All scripts are are located under `./scripts/` directory and can be executed directly by `node scripts/<file_name>`.

#### Generate Config

This script will help you to generate unified version of configuration file for any network. Here is the usage of the script:

```
Usage: generate_config [options] <network>

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
```

Argument `network` is required and can by `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet` or any other network folder available under `./config` directory.

#### Update Config

This script keep track of all changes introduced in Lisk over time in different versions. If you have one config file in any of specific version and you want to make it compatible with other version of the Lisk, this scripts will do it for you.

```
Usage: update_config [options] <input_file> <from_version> [to_version]

Options:

-h, --help     output usage information
-V, --version  output the version number
--output       Output file path
--diff         Show only difference from default config file.
```

As you can see from the usage guide, `input_file` and `from_version` are required. So if you have a config file, you must be aware to which version of Lisk this belongs. You can skip the `to_version` argument and it will apply changes up-to latest version of Lisk. If you don't specify `--output` path the final config json will be printed to console. Option `--diff` is useful if you just want to know what are the changes in your version compared to default config located in `./config/default/config.json`.

#### Console

This script is really useful in development. It will initialize the components of Lisk and load these into ndoejs REPL.

```
node scripts/console.js

initApplication: Application initialization inside test environment started...
initApplication: Target database - lisk_dev
initApplication: Rewired modules available
initApplication: Fake onBlockchainReady event called
initApplication: Loading delegates...
initApplication: Delegates loaded from config file - 101
initApplication: Done
lisk-core [lisk_dev] >
```

Once you get the prompt, you can use `modules`, `helpers`, `logic`, `db` and `config` objects and play with these in REPL.
