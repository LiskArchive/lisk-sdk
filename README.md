## Prerequisites - In order

This sections provides details on what you need install on your system in order to run Lisk.

### System Install

- Tool chain components -- Used for compiling dependencies

    - Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y python build-essential curl automake autoconf libtool
        ```

    - MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

        Make sure that you have both [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your machine.

        Update homebrew and install dependencies:

        ```
        brew update
        brew doctor
        brew install curl automake autoconf libtool
        ```

- Git (<https://github.com/git/git>) -- Used for cloning and updating Lisk

    - Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```
        sudo apt-get install -y git
        ```

    - MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

        ```
        brew install git
        ```

### Node.js (<https://nodejs.org/>)

- Node.js serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

    Install System wide via package manager:

    - Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        ```

    - MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

        ```
        brew install node@6.12.3
        ```

- _(Recommended)_ Install using a version manager such as nvm.
    1. Install nvm following their instructions (https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
    2. Install the correct version of Node.js using nvm:
    ```
    nvm install 6.12.3
    ```

- _(Recommended)_ PM2 (<https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>) -- PM2 manages the node process for Lisk

  ```
  npm install -g pm2
  ```

### PostgreSQL (version 9.6):

   - Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```
        curl -sL "https://downloads.lisk.io/scripts/setup_postgresql.Linux" | bash -
        sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb $USER
        createdb lisk_test
        createdb lisk_main
        sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_test -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
        sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_main -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
        ```

   - MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

        ```
        brew install postgresql@9.6
        initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
        brew services start postgresql@9.6
        createdb lisk_test
        createdb lisk_main
        ```

### Installing Redis

   - Ubuntu/Debian:

        ```
        sudo apt-get install redis-server
        ```

        Start redis:

        ```
        service redis start
        ```

        Stop redis:

        ```
        service redis stop
        ```

   - MacOS 10.12-10.13 (Sierra/High Sierra):

        ```
        brew install redis
        ```

        Start redis:

        ```
        brew services start redis
        ```

        Stop redis:

        ```
        brew services stop redis
        ```

**NOTE:** Lisk does not run on the redis default port of 6379. Instead it is configured to run on port: 6380. Because of this, in order for Lisk to run, you have one of two options:

1. **Change the Lisk configuration**

  Update the redis port configuration in both `config.json` and `test/data/config.json`. Note that this is the easiest option, however, be mindful of reverting the changes should you make a pull request.

2. **Change the Redis launch configuration**

  Update the launch configuration file on your system. Note that their a number of ways to do this. The following is one way:

  1. Stop redis-server
  2. Edit the file `redis.conf` and change: `port 6379` to `port 6380`
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `/etc/redis/redis.conf`
    - MacOS: `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf`
  3. Start redis-server

  Now confirm that redis is running on `port 6380`:

  ```
  redis-cli -p 6380
  ping
  ```

  And you should get the result `PONG`.

## Installation Steps

Clone the Lisk repository using git and initialize the modules.

```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
git checkout master
npm install
```

## Managing Lisk

To test that Lisk is built and configured correctly, issue the following command:

```
node app.js
```

Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `pm2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

```
pm2 start --name lisk app.js
```

After the process is started, its runtime status and log location can be retrieved by issuing the following command:

```
pm2 show lisk
```

To stop Lisk after it has been started with `pm2`, issue the following command:

```
pm2 stop lisk
```

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:

```
pm2 start --name lisk app.js -- -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path]
```

## Tests

### Preparing Node

1. Recreate the database in order to run the tests against a new blockchain:

  ```
  dropdb lisk_test
  createdb lisk_test
  ```

2. Ensure Lisk is configured to run on the same local network used by the tests. Replace the files **config.json** and **genesisBlock.json** with those located under the **test/data** directory:

  ```
  cp test/data/config.json test/data/genesisBlock.json .
  ```

3. Launch Lisk (runs on port 4000):

  ```
  NODE_ENV=test node app.js
  ```

### Running Tests

Tests are run using the following command:

```
npm test -- mocha:<tag>:<suite>:[section]
```

- Where **tag** can be one of `slow | unstable | untagged | extensive` (required)
- Where **suite** can be one of `unit | functional | integration`  (required)
- Where **section** depending of the chosen suite can be:
    - when `functional` --> `get | post | ws | system` (optional)

Individual test files can be run using the following command:

```
npm run mocha -- path/to/test.js
```

### Genesis Account

The master passphrase for the genesis block used by the tests is as follows:

```
wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble
```
