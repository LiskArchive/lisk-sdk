Lisk is a next generation crypto-currency and decentralized application platform, written entirely in JavaScript. The official documentation about the whole ecosystem can be found in https://lisk.io/documentation.

[Lisk Core](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core) is the program that implements the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol). In other words, Lisk Core is what every machine needs to set-up in order to run a node that allows for participation in the network.

This document details how to install Lisk Core from source, but there are two other ways to participate in the network: [binaries](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/pre-install/binary) and [Docker images](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/setup/pre-install/docker).
If you have satisfied the requirements from the Pre-Installation section, you can jumpt directly to the next section [Installation Steps](#installation).

## Pre-Installation

The next section details the prerequisites to install Lisk Core from source using the different tagged releases.

### System Install

#### Create new user `lisk`

* Ubuntu:

```
sudo adduser lisk
```

Note: The lisk user itself does not need any sudo rights to run Lisk Core.

#### Tool chain components

Used for compiling dependencies.

* Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python build-essential curl automake autoconf libtool ntp
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.14 (Sierra/High Sierra/Mojave)::

Make sure that you have both [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your machine.

Update homebrew and install dependencies:

```
brew update
brew doctor
brew install curl automake autoconf libtool
```

### [Git](https://github.com/git/git)

Used for cloning and updating Lisk

* Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install -y git
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.14 (Sierra/High Sierra/Mojave)::

```
brew install git
```

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Node.js serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

Install System wide via package manager:

* Ubuntu:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.14 (Sierra/High Sierra/Mojave)::

```
brew install node@10.14.1
```

#### Check correct version

Especially when installing on Ubuntu, check if you have a compatible node version runnging:

```
node -v
```

Compare with [package.json](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/blob/development/package.json#L19)

Best practice to manage node version is to install a node version manager like `nvm` or `n`.

##### [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (recommended)

1. Login as lisk user, that has been created in the first step:

```
su - lisk
```

2. Install nvm following these [instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
3. Install the correct version of Node.js using nvm:

```
nvm install 10.14.1
```

For the following steps, logout from the 'lisk' user again with `CTRL+D`, and continue with your user with sudo rights.

### PostgreSQL:

* Ubuntu:

Firstly, download and install postgreSQL 10:

```
sudo apt-get purge -y postgres* # remove all already installed postgres versions
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
sudo apt install wget ca-certificates
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-10
```

After installation, you should see the postgres database cluster, by running

```
  pg_lsclusters
```

Drop the existing database cluster, and replace it with a cluster with the locale `en_US.UTF-8`:

```
  sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 10 main
  sudo pg_createcluster --locale en_US.UTF-8 --start 10 main
```

Create a new database user called `lisk` and grant it rights to create databases:

```
  sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb lisk
```

Create the databases for Testnet and Mainnet:

```
  createdb -O lisk lisk_test
  createdb -O lisk lisk_main
```

Change `'password'` to a secure password of your choice.

```
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_test -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_main -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.14 (Sierra/High Sierra/Mojave)::

```
brew install postgresql@10
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres@10 --encoding utf8 --locale=en_US.UTF-8
brew services start postgresql@10
createdb lisk_test
createdb lisk_main
```

### Redis (optional)

If you do not plan to use the API of your node for some reason, you can skip this step.

Redis is an optional dependency, that caches database queries that need to be done to answer API requests.

It is recommended to install Redis to improve the performance of API responses.

* Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

Start redis:

```
service redis start
```

Stop redis:

```
service redis stop
```

* MacOS 10.12-10.14 (Sierra/High Sierra/Mojave):

```
brew install redis
```

Start redis:

```
brew services start redis
```

Stop redis:

```
brew services stop redis
```

**NOTE:** Lisk does not run on the Redis default port of 6379. Instead it is configured to run on port: 6380. Because of this, in order for Lisk to run, you have one of two options:

1. **Change the Redis launch configuration**

Update the launch configuration file on your system. Note that there are a number of ways to do this.

The following is one example:

1. Stop redis-server
2. Edit the file `redis.conf` and change: `port 6379` to `port 6380`
   * Ubuntu: `/etc/redis/redis.conf`
   * MacOS: `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf`
3. Start redis-server

Now confirm that redis is running on `port 6380`:

```bash
redis-cli -p 6380
> ping
```

And you should get the result `PONG`.
To exit the `redis-cli`, type `exit`.

2. **Change the Lisk configuration**

To update the redis port in the Lisk configuration, check the section [Configuring Lisk](#configuring-lisk)

## Installation

Clone the Lisk Core repository using Git and initialize the modules.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
git checkout master
npm ci
```

## Managing Lisk

To test Lisk is built and configured correctly, issue the following command at the root level of the project:

```
npm start
```

This will start the lisk instance with `devnet` configuration. Once the process is verified as running correctly, use `CTRL+C` to quit the running application.
Optionally, start the process with `pm2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

```
npx pm2 start --name lisk src/index.js
```

After the process is started, its runtime status and log location can be retrieved by issuing the following command:

```
npx pm2 show lisk
```

To stop Lisk after it has been started with `pm2`, issue the following command:

```
npx pm2 stop lisk
```

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:

```
npx pm2 start --name lisk src/index.js -- -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path] -n [network]
```

You can pass any of `devnet`, `alphanet`, `betanet`, `testnet` or `mainnet` for the network option.
More information about options can be found at [Command Line Options](#command-line-options).

## Configuring Lisk

### Structure

1. The Lisk configuration is managed under different folder structures.
2. Root folder for all configuration is `./config/`.
3. Default configuration file that used as base is `config/default/config.json`
4. You can find network specific configurations under `config/<network>/config.json`
5. Don't override any value in above mentioned files if you need custom configuration.
6. Create your own `json` file and pass it as command line options `-c` or `LISK_CONFIG_FILE`
7. Configurations will be loaded in following order, lowest in the list have highest priority:
   * Default configuration file
   * Network specific configuration file
   * Custom configuration file (if specified by user)
   * Command line configurations, specified as command `flags` or `env` variables
8. Any config option of array type gets completely overridden. If you specify one peer at `peers.list` in your custom config file, it will replace every default peer for the network.
9. For development use `devnet` as the network option.

### Command Line Options

There are plenty of options available that you can use to override configuration on runtime while starting the lisk.

```
npm start -- [options]
```

Each of that option can be appended on command line. There are also few `ENV` variables that can be utilized for this purpose.

#### Note

* All `ENV` variables restricted with operating system constraint of `ENV` variable maximum length.
* Comma separated lists will replace the original config values. e.g. If you specify `LISK_PEERS`, original `peers.list` specific to network will be replaced completely.

For more detail understanding of configuration read this [online documentation](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/user-guide/configuration)

### Examples

#### Change Redis Port

Update the `redis.port` configuration attribute in `config/devnet/config.json` or any other network you want to configure.

## Tests

### Preparing Node

1. Recreate the database in order to run the tests against a new blockchain:

```
dropdb lisk_dev
createdb lisk_dev
```

2. Launch Lisk (runs on port 4000):

```
NODE_ENV=test npm start
```

### Running Tests

Starting from version `1.6.0`, Lisk Core will be using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as its main test runner and gradually deprecate [mocha](https://mochajs.org). Since rewriting all existing mocha tests is not feasible at the moment, we are going to have two test runners in our code base:

* Modules (all source code under `framework/src/modules` folder) will be tested using `mocha` and test files should be located under `framework/test/mocha`.
* Framework (all of the source files but `framework/src/modules`) will be tested using `jest` and test files should be located under `framework/test/jest`.
* Functional and Network tests suites will be using `mocha` and test files should be located under `framework/test/mocha`.

#### Running Mocha Tests

Tests are run using the following command:

```
npm test -- mocha:<tag>:<suite>:[section]
```

* Where **tag** can be one of `default | unstable | slow | extensive` (required)
* Where **suite** can be one of `unit | integration | functional | network` (required)
* Where **section** depending of the chosen suite can be:
  * when `functional` --> `get | post | ws` (optional)

Examples:

```
npm test -- mocha:slow:unit
npm test -- mocha:extensive:integration
npm test -- mocha:default:functional
npm test -- mocha:unstable:functional:get
npm test -- mocha:untagged:network
```

Individual test files can be run using the following command:

```
npm run mocha -- path/to/test.js
```

#### Running Jest Tests

```
npm run jest:<testType>
```

`testType` can be `unit`|`integration`|`functional`

##### Executing the tests per file:

```
npm run jest:<testType> -- [filepath] [jest-options]
```

## Utility Scripts

There are couple of command line scripts that facilitate users of lisk to perform handy operations. All scripts are located under `./framework/src/modules/chain/scripts/` directory and can be executed directly by `node framework/src/modules/chain/scripts/<file_name>`.

#### Generate Config

This script will help you to generate unified version of configuration file for any network. Here is the usage of the script:

```
Usage: generate_config [options]

Options:

-h, --help               output usage information
-V, --version            output the version number
-c, --config [config]    custom config file
-n, --network [network]  specify the network or use LISK_NETWORK
```

Argument `network` is required and can by `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet` or any other network folder available under `./config` directory.

#### Update Config

This script keep track of all changes introduced in Lisk over time in different versions. If you have one config file in any of specific version and you want to make it compatible with other version of the Lisk, this scripts will do it for you.

```
Usage: update_config [options] <input_file> <from_version> [to_version]

Options:

-h, --help               output usage information
-V, --version            output the version number
-n, --network [network]  specify the network or use LISK_NETWORK
-o, --output [output]    output file path
```

As you can see from the usage guide, `input_file` and `from_version` are required. If you skip `to_version` argument changes in config.json will be applied up to the latest version of Lisk Core. If you do not specify `--output` path the final config.json will be printed to stdout. If you do not specify `--network` argument you will have to load it from `LISK_NETWORK` env variable.

#### Console (Unmaintained)

This script is really useful in development. It will initialize the components of Lisk and load these into Node.js REPL.

```bash
node framework/src/modules/chain/scripts/console.js

initApplication: Application initialization inside test environment started...
initApplication: Target database - lisk_dev
initApplication: Rewired modules available
initApplication: Fake onBlockchainReady event called
initApplication: Loading delegates...
initApplication: Delegates loaded from config file - 101
initApplication: Done
lisk-core [lisk_dev] >
```

Once you get the prompt, you can use `modules`, `helpers`, `logic`, `storage` and `config` objects and play with these in REPL.

## Performance Monitoring

We used [newrelic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor the activities inside application. It enables to have detail insight
of the system and keep track of performance of each activity. e.g. An HTTP API call or a background job from queue.

To enable the performance monitoring on your node make sure you have an environment variable `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
available and set and then start the node normally. The monitoring data will be visible to your newrelic account with the
name of the network you started. e.g. `lisk-mainnet`, `lisk-testnet`.
