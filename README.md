**NOTE:** The following information is applicable to: **Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 (LTS) or 16.10 - x86_64**.

## Prerequisites - In order

This sections provides details on what you need install on your system in order to run Lisk.

### System Install

Tool chain components -- Used for compiling dependencies

- Linux:

  `sudo apt-get install -y python build-essential curl automake autoconf libtool`

- Mac:

  Make sure that you have both XCode and Brew installed on your machine.

  Update homebrew:

  ```
  brew update
  brew doctor
  ```

  Install Lunchy  for easier starting and stoping of services:

  `gem install lunchy`


Git (<https://github.com/git/git>) -- Used for cloning and updating Lisk

- Linux:

  `sudo apt-get install -y git`

- Mac:

  `brew install git`

### Nodejs Install

Node.js (<https://nodejs.org/>) -- Node.js serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

- Linux:
  ```
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```

- Mac:

  `brew install node`

### (Optional) Node Version Manager

[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

- Linux

  ```
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
  nvm install v6.10.1
  ```

- Mac

  You can install the optional NVM from [this tutorial.](http://dev.topheman.com/install-nvm-with-homebrew-to-use-multiple-versions-of-node-and-iojs-easily/)


### NPM Installs

- Bower (<http://bower.io/>): Bower helps to install required JavaScript dependencies.
- Grunt.js (<http://gruntjs.com/>): Grunt is used to compile the frontend code and serves other functions.
- PM2 (<https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>): PM2 manages the node process for Lisk (Optional)

    `npm install -g bower grunt-cli pm2`

### Install PostgreSQL (version 9.6.2):

**NOTE:** Database user requires privileges to `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto`.

- Linux
  ```
  curl -sL "https://downloads.lisk.io/scripts/setup_postgresql.Linux" | bash -
  sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb $USER
  createdb lisk_test
  createdb lisk_main
  sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_test -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
  sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_main -c "alter user "$USER" with password 'password';"
  ```

- Mac
  ```
  brew install postgresql
  initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
  mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.2.1/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
  lunchy start postgres
  createdb lisk_test
  createdb lisk_main
  ```
### Installing redis

- Linux:
  ```
  wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
  tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
  cd redis-stable
  make
  redis-server
  ```

- Mac:
  ```
  brew install redis
  lunchy start redis
  ```

**NOTE:** Lisk does not run on the redis default port of 6379. Instead it is configured to run on port: 6380. Because of this, in order for Lisk to run, you have one of two options:

#### Change The Lisk Configuration

Update the redis port configuration in both config.json and test/config.json. Note that this is the easiest option, however, be mindfull of reverting the changes should you make a pull request.

#### Change The Redis Launch configuration

Update the launch configuration file on your system. Note that their a number of ways to do this. The following is one way:

1. Stop Redis on your computer. [{ Linux: `redis-server stop` },{ Mac: `lunchy stop redis` }]
2. Open the /usr/local/etc/redis.conf file and change this: `port 6379` to `port 6380`
3. Restart Redis. [{ Linux: `redis-server` },{ Mac: `lunchy start redis` }]

Now confirm that your is running on port 6380.
```
redis-cli -p 6380
ping
```
and you should get the result of 'PONG'

## Installation Steps

Clone the Lisk repository using Git and initialize the modules.

```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
npm install
```

## Managing Lisk

To test that Lisk is built and configured correctly, run the following command:

`node app.js`

In a browser navigate to: <http://localhost:8000> (for the mainnet) or <http://localhost:7000> (for the testnet). If Lisk is running on a remote system, switch `localhost` for the external IP Address of the machine.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `pm2`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

`pm2 start --name lisk app.js`

After the process is started, its runtime status and log location can be retrieved by issuing the following command:

`pm2 show lisk`

To stop Lisk after it has been started with `pm2`, issue the following command:

`pm2 stop lisk`

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:

```
pm2 start --name lisk app.js -- -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path]
```

## Tests

Before running any tests, please ensure Lisk is configured to run on the same testnet that is used by the test-suite.

Replace **config.json** and **genesisBlock.json** with the corresponding files under the **test** directory

```
cp test/config.json test/genesisBlock.json .
```

**NOTE:** If the node was started with a different genesis block previous, trauncate the database before running tests.

```
dropdb lisk_test
createdb lisk_test
```

**NOTE:** Remember to manage the Redis non-default port setting of 6380 as described above.

**NOTE:** The master passphrase for this genesis block is as follows:

```
wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble
```

Launch Lisk (runs on port 4000):

```
node app.js
```

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

Run individual tests:

```
npm test -- test/lib/accounts.js
npm test -- test/lib/transactions.js
```
