## What is Lisk Elements

Lisk Elements is a collection of libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc. Each library is designed to be compatible with the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol).

Lisk Elements supports the modular architecture of the Lisk SDK, where libraries can be created or modified to suit individual blockchain application requirements.

## Installation

If you want to install all elements as dependency of your project you can install it via.

```sh
$ npm install --save lisk-elements
```

Or you can install individual packages what you need e.g.

```sh
$ npm install --save @liskhq/lisk-transactions
$ npm install --save @liskhq/lisk-cryptography
```

## Usage

Access functionality via the relevant namespace. For example, the following will create and (locally) sign a transfer (type 0) transaction, and then broadcast it to the Lisk Testnet.

```js
const { APIClient, transaction } = require('lisk-elements');

const transferTransaction = lisk.transaction.transfer({
	amount: '123000000',
	recipientId: '12668885769632475474L',
	passphrase:
		'robust swift grocery peasant forget share enable convince deputy road keep cheap',
});

const client = APIClient.createTestnetAPIClient();

client.transactions
	.broadcast(transferTransaction)
	.then(console.info)
	.catch(console.error);
```

Full documentation can be found on the [Lisk documentation site][].

### Running Tests

To run tests for all packages in lisk-elements, run the following command in the root folder:

```
npm test
```

To run tests for a specific package, run the same command in the relevant package directory.

Example:

```
cd packages/lisk-cryptography
npm test
```
