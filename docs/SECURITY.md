# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The `LiskHQ` contributors and community take all security bugs in `lisk-sdk` seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use [admin@lisk.com](mailto:admin@lisk.com). To coordinate the issue and solve it.

The contributors will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request, use this [template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Security Is Everyone's Responsibility

Thank you for making the world a better place for everyone!
