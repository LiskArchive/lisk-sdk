		<p translate>You are about to register a blockchain application on the Lisk network. After the registration completes, Lisk users will be able to see your application in the Lisk application directory, and they will also be able to install and launch it.<br><br>Please note, one of the characteristics of blockchains is that they are immutable. Therefore make sure you have used the correct application parameters. We also advise you to test your application on the official Lisk testnet so you can guarantee that it is working flawlessly.<br><br><b>Things you need to know for the registration process:</b><br><br>• Application names are unique, therefore you can't register the same name twice on the Lisk network.<br>• Each application is linked to a corresponding zip archive and optional icon.<br>• Make sure that your application icon has a square aspect ratio.<br>• Choose your tags wisely, as they will be used as search keywords within the application directory.<br><br>The Lisk Team does not accept liability for any blockchain applications uploaded to the network, solely the uploader does. Therefore please ensure your blockchain application is legal within your jurisdiction and doesn't pose any harm to its users.</p>
