## What is Lisk Framework

Lisk Framework is an application framework responsible for establishing and maintaining the interactions between the modules of a Lisk blockchain application.

Lisk Framework aims to provide a consistent and intuitive interface between each module and component. Currently, Lisk Framework establishes interactions between the `chain`, `api` and `network` modules.

### Architecture Overview

The architecture of Lisk Framework follows the research documented in [LIP0005](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0005.md). The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

## Installation and usage

To install and use Lisk Framework follow the steps described in the [Lisk SDK installation](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk#installation) and [usage](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk#usage) sections.

## Tests

### Preparing Node

1. Recreate the database to run the tests against a new blockchain:

```
dropdb lisk_dev
createdb lisk_dev
```

2. Launch Lisk (runs on port 4000):

```
NODE_ENV=test npm start
```

### Running Tests

Starting from version `1.6.0`, Lisk Framework will be using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as its main test runner with gradual deprecation of [mocha](https://mochajs.org). Since rewriting all existing mocha tests is not feasible at the moment, we have two test runners in our code base:

- Modules (all source code under `framework/src/modules` folder) will be tested using `mocha` and test files should be located under `framework/test/mocha`.
- Framework (all of the source files but `framework/src/modules`) will be tested using `jest` and test files should be located under `framework/test/jest`.
- Functional and Network tests suites will be using `mocha` and test files should be located under `framework/test/mocha`.

#### Running Mocha Tests

Tests are run using the following command:

```
npm run mocha:<testType> -- [testPathPattern] [mochaCliOptions]
```

- Where **testType** can be one of `unit`, `integration`, `functional:ws`, `functional:get`, `functional:post`, `functional:put`, `functional`, `network` (required).
- Where **testPathPattern** is a regexp pattern string that is matched against all tests paths before executing the test (optional).
- Where **mochaCliOptions** can be any of mocha's [`command line options`](https://mochajs.org/#command-line-usage) (optional).

Examples:

```
# Running unit tests
npm run mocha:unit
npm run mocha:unit -- --grep @slow
npm run mocha:unit -- --grep @unstable
### extensive
npm run mocha:unit -- --grep="@unstable" --invert

# Running functional tests
npm run mocha:functional:ws
npm run mocha:functional:get
npm run mocha:functional:post
npm run mocha:functional:put
```

Individual test files can be run using the following commands:

```bash
npm run mocha:unit -- <testPathPattern> [mochaCliOptions]
```

or

```bash
npm run mocha <filepath> [mochaCliOptions]
```

or

```bash
npx mocha <filepath> [mochaCliOptions]
```

#### Running Jest Tests

```
npm run jest:<testType>
```

`testType` can be `unit`|`integration`|`functional`

##### Executing the tests per file:

```
npm run jest:<testType> -- [testPathPattern] [jestCliOptions]
```

### API Performance and APM

To access the API Performance of your Lisk Instance, navigate to `http://localhost:4000/http-stats/ui`. The APM doesn't store any of the performance metrics, neither it forwards to any external services. The stats are served from the point on the instance is up and running, once the instance is restarted it will not hold any stats.

To access the stats, follow the steps below:

```
node test/test_app | npx bunyan
Access: http://localhost:4000/http-stats/ui
```

## Contribution

To test the changes in framework you can run,

`node test/test_app` or `node test/test_app | npx bunyan`

If you want to test the changes in `lisk-sdk/elements` to reflect in `lisk-sdk/framework`, please make sure you run `npm run build` at `lisk-sdk` after making any changes in elements library and run `node test/test_app`.
