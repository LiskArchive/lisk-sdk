## Description

Modules are individual building blocks for Lisk Core.

### Core Modules

Core Modules are shipped along with the Lisk Core distribution itself. These modules constitute the minimum requirements to run a functional Lisk Core instance.

#### List of Core Modules

- **HTTP API Module:** provides API endpoints, that enable users and other programs to communicate with the Lisk blockchain through the API.

### Custom Modules

> The implementation of each module is up-to user but it must inherit from `BaseModule` class and implement its methods.

Custom Modules can be plugged into Lisk Core and may offer new features/capabilities for the application, or replace Core modules functionalities.
They extend the existing instance with a specific (and circumscribed) set of features.

```js
// Exported as main file to javascript package
export default class MyModule extends BaseModule {
    /**
    * Constructor of the module.
    *
     * @param {Object} options - An object of module options
    */
    constructor(options) {
     super(options);
    }

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * A unique module identifier, that can be accessed through out the system.
    * If some module already registered with the same alias, it will throw an error.
    *
    * @return {string} alias - Return the module alias as string.
    * */
    static get alias(){ return 'moduleAlias'; },

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * Package meta information.
    *
    * @return {Object} info - JSON object referring the version, module name, and module author.
    */
    static get info(){
        return {
            author: '',
            version: '',
            name: '',
        };
    },

    /**
    * Required.
    *
    * Method which will be invoked by controller to load the module.
    * Make sure all loading logic get completed during the life cycle of load.
    * Controller emit an event `app:ready` which you can use to perform
    * some activities which you want to perform when every other module is loaded.
    *
    * @param {Channel} channel - An instance of a communication channel.
    * @return {Promise<void>}
    */
    async load(channel) {},


    /**
     * Supported configurations for the module with default values.
     *
     * @return {Object} defaults - JSON object with default options for the module.
     */
    get defaults() { return {}; },

    /**
     * List of valid events which this module wants to register with the controller.
     * Each event name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:event1.
     * Listing an event means to register the event in the application.
     * Any module can subscribe or publish that event in the application.
     *
     * @return {Array} events - String Array of events.
     */
    get events() { return []; },

    /**
     * Object of valid actions which this module want to register with the controller.
     * Each action name will be prefixed by module alias, e.g. moduleName:action1.
     * Source module can define the action while others can invoke that action.
     *
     * @return {Object} actions - Contains all available action names as key, and the corresponding function as value.
     */
    get actions() {
        return {
            action1: action => {},
        }
    },

    /**
     * Method to be invoked by controller to perform the cleanup.
     *
     * @return {Promise<void>}
     */
    async unload() {},
};
```

## Module Configuration

Configuration options for each module are located in `framework/src/modules/<module-name>/defaults/config.js`.

Each `config.js` file consists of 2 parts:

1. JSON-schema specification for all available config options
2. Default values for the available config options for this specific module.

Please don't change the default values in these files directly as they will be overwritten on software updates, instead define the custom configuration options inside your blockchain application.

## Module Communication

Modules communicate with each other through event-based channels.
Modules running in different processes communicate with each other over IPC channels.

### InMemory Channel

Communicates with modules which reside in the same process as the [controller](../controller/README.md).

By default, modules will load in the same process as the controller.

### Child Process Channel

Communicates with modules which do not reside in the same process as the Controller.

To load a module as a child process, make sure you have `ipc` enabled in the config file and set the option `loadAsChildProcess: true` when registering the module using the Application method `registerModule`.

Currently, the only Lisk native module supported is HTTP API module which will be loaded as child process if you have `ipc` enabled.

## Module Life Cycle

The controller will load/unload each module one after another.
A modules' life cycle consists of following events in the right order:

**Loading**

- _module_:registeredToBus
- _module_:loading:started
- _module_:loading:finished
