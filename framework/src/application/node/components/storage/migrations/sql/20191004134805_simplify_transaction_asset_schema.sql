  DESCRIPTION: Simplifies the schema for the 'asset' field in the transactions table 'trs'
  - For second signature registration moves the object in 'signature' to the root level of the asset field
  - For delegate registration transactions moves the object in 'delegate' to the root level of the asset field
  - For vote transactions no changes required as the asset field already contains voted public keys at the root level
  - For multisignature transactions moves the object in 'multisignature' to the root level of the asset field
  PARAMETERS: None
