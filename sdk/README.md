## Sapphire phase [<img src="https://lisk.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/ico-sapphire.png" style="width:24px;vertical-align:middle">](https://lisk.com/roadmap)

We have completed [Emerald phase](https://lisk.com/roadmap)[<img src="https://lisk.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/ico-emerald.png" style="width:20px;vertical-align:middle">](https://lisk.com/roadmap) that encapsulates improvement in the key areas of network security and reliability, economics, consensus and longevity. Specifically a new address system, new fee system and and an upgraded consensus algorithm for an improved version of DPoS were successfully completed. During the Emerald phase all protocol improvements in the form of 36 Lisk Improvement Proposals (LIPs) were researched, published and implemented in Lisk SDK.

We are currently working on [Sapphire phase](https://lisk.com/roadmap)[<img src="https://lisk.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/ico-sapphire.png" style="width:20px;vertical-align:middle">](https://lisk.com/roadmap) that brings the [Lisk interoperability solution](https://lisk.com/blog/research/lisk-interoperability-solution-published). All related Lisk Improvement Proposals (LIPs) are published and implementation is currently being actively developed. It consists of 8 roadmap objectives,

- Define cross-chain messaging protocol
- Define sidechain registration and lifecycle
- Introduce token standards for the Lisk ecosystem
- Introduce alternative validator selection mechanism for sidechains
- Enhance signature scheme
- Define state model and state root
- Update Lisk-BFT for interoperability
- Update block header format

To learn more about the Lisk Interoperability and the current development status, check out [Lisk Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips), [Research Forum](https://research.lisk.com/), [Lisk interoperability solution blog](https://lisk.com/blog/research/lisk-interoperability-solution-published) and [Lisk SDK v6.0.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/LiskHQ/projects/10/views/4).

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications using the Lisk SDK, and shall look forward to receiving your feedback and contributions during the beta phase.

## What is the Lisk SDK?

The Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development kit for building blockchain applications which are compatible with the [Lisk Protocol](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-sdk/protocol). The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain application use-cases. The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a majority of developers, no significant change of tools or mindset is required to get started. The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain application, and nothing more.

## Usage

### Documentation

For more detailed documentation, see the [official Lisk SDK documentation](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-sdk).

#### Dependencies

Before running Lisk SDK, the following dependencies need to be installed in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:

| Dependencies | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| NodeJS       | 16+     |

For Mac M1 series,
NodeJS must be above version 16. Additionally, to build `sodium-native` below tools are required.

```
brew install libtool cmake autoconf automake pyenv
pyenv install 2.7.18
pyenv global 2.7.18
# Add `eval "$(pyenv init --path)"` to ~/.zshrc etc
```

### Installation

The installation of Lisk Beta SDK is straightforward and limited to getting a single NPM package, `lisk-sdk`, to your Node.js project:

```
npm install lisk-sdk@beta
```

Lisk SDK is all-in-one package that provides you with tools to create, run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

### Set up new a blockchain application

To start, create the project structure of your blockchain application. There are no special requirements here, you can create the basic Node.js project folder structure with `npm init`.

To create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point of your application (like `index.js`) and set-up your network by using the modules of Lisk SDK.

It is quite simple to have a working blockchain application, mirroring the configuration of the existing Lisk network. This can be done by copying the following three lines of code to your `index.js`:

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');

const { app } = Application.defaultApplication(
	genesisBlockDevnet,
	configDevnet
);

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
```

After that you can start the application by:

```
node index.js
```

### Configure your blockchain parameters

You can also define your blockchain application parameters such as `blockTime`, `maxTransactionsSize` and more with an optional configurations object.

```js
const { app } = Application.defaultApplication(genesisBlockDevnet, {
    genesisConfig: {
      communityIdentifier: 'newChain',
      blockTime: 5,
      maxTransactionsSize: 100 * 1024,
      minRemainingBalance: "5000000",
	  activeDelegates: 101,
	  standbyDelegates: 2,
	  delegateListRoundOffset: 2
    },
    ...
});
```

### Register a custom module or a custom plugin

A custom module is a logic to define state changes that will be executed on-chain meaning that it will be a part of the blockchain protocol.
On the other hand, a custom plugin is a logic to define an off-chain logic which is not part of the blockchain protocol but to enhance the application features.

Add your custom module and custom plugin to your blockchain application by registering it to the application instance:

```js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');

const MyModule = require('./my_module');
const MyPlugin = require('./my_plugin');

const { app } = Application.defaultApplication(
	genesisBlockDevnet,
	configDevnet
);

app.registerModule(MyModule); // register the custom module
app.registerPlugin(MyPlugin); // register the custom plugin

app
	.run()
	.then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error('Faced error in application', error);
		process.exit(1);
	});
```

## Architecture Overview

The Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an application framework (Lisk Framework), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application functionalities (Lisk Elements), and a powerful command-line tool (Lisk Commander) helping developers to build a blockchain application using Lisk Framework. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

## How to Contribute

To contribute to `lisk-sdk`, `framework` or `elements`:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk.git`

2. Install [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) globally: (please note that we are still on Yarn 1.xx)

3. Install dependencies and build:
   1. `yarn`
   2. `yarn build`

### Testing your local `lisk-sdk` in your application.

In order to link your local lisk-sdk repository and test your application which uses `lisk-sdk`, simply follow the steps below in your local `lisk-sdk` repository and run `yarn link lisk-sdk` in the root of your application.

1. `cd sdk`

2. `yarn link`

3. Once you have linked your local repo, everytime you make changes in `lisk-sdk/elements` you must build packages before testing:

   a. To build all packages: `npm run build` or `yarn build`

   b. To build specific package: `yarn workspace <package name> build` or go into each package folder and `yarn build` or `npm run build`
   Example: `yarn workspace @liskhq/lisk-p2p build`

**Note:** In case you face any issues during the installation make sure you have the right version of `yarn` and `node` and try reset project with `yarn clean:full`.
