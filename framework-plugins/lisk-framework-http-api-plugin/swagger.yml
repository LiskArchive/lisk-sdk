    # Welcome!

    ## Access restrictions
    The API endpoints are by default restricted to a whitelist of IPs that can be found under `modules.http_api.access.whiteList` in the config.
    If it is required for your API to be accessible by the public, this can be achieved by changing `modules.http_api.access.public` to `true`.
    This will allow anyone to make requests to your Lisk Core node.
    However some endpoints will stay private, hence this means that only a list of whitelisted IPs can successfully make API calls to that particular endpoint;
    this includes all forging related API calls.
    By default, only the nodes' local IP is also included in the whitelist, nevertheless it is possible to change the setting in `config` under `modules.http_api.forging.access.whiteList`.
    For more details, see the [Lisk Core management docs](https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/3.0.0/management/) or the descriptions at the respective endpoint below.

    ## Requests
    Chained filter parameters are logically connected with `AND`.
    `HTTP` is the supported URL schema by default.
    To enable `HTTPS`, please adjust the `modules.http_api.ssl` section in the config.

    ## Responses
    The general response format is JSON (`application/json`).
    The responses for each API request have a common basic structure as shown below:
    ```javascript
    {
        "data": {}, //Contains the requested data.
        "meta": {}, //Contains additional metadata, e.g. the values of `limit` and `offset`.
        "links": {} //Will contain links to connected API calls from here, e.g. pagination links.
    }
    ```

    ## Date formats
    Most of the timestamp parameters are in the Lisk timestamp format, which is similar to the Unix timestamp format.
    The **Lisk timestamp** is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Lisk epoch time (2016-05-24T17:00:00.000Z), not counting leap seconds.
    The **Lisk epoch time** is returned in the [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, combined with the date and time: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`.
    For details, see the descriptions and examples at the respective endpoint.

    ## Pagination
    It is possible to easily paginate through the results by providing `limit` and `offset` parameters to the requests.
    `limit` and `offset` can be found in the `meta`-object of the response of an API request.
    If no limit and offset are provided they are set to 10 and 0 by default, which in turn will display the first 10 results.
